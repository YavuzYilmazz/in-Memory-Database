# .NET Core In-Memory Database Learning Project

This project has been developed to learn and implement in-memory databases using .NET Core. In-memory databases are commonly used for storing temporary data, retaining data throughout the application's runtime.

## Project Structure

- **Models:** Contains classes representing the application's data model.
- **Data:** Includes classes responsible for performing database operations.
- **Validators:** Contains classes used for data validation processes.
- **Enums:** Includes classes related to enumeration types.

## Technologies Used

- **Entity Framework Core:** Utilized for database operations, providing a mapping between model classes and database tables.
- **Validator Library:** Used for data validation processes, validating user inputs and managing appropriate errors.
- **Enum Usage:** Enumerations (enum) types are employed to represent specific states or conditions.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project folder in the terminal or command prompt and use the `dotnet restore` command to install dependencies.

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

2. **Run the Application:** Start the application using the following command.

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

After following these steps, the application should start and perform basic operations using the in-memory database.
